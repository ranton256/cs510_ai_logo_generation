## Project Proposal at 
https://www.overleaf.com/project/60995abeb573de49ae69fbae

## Copyright
Some of the code in this repo is from https://github.com/gttugsuu/Constrained-Neural-Style-Transfer-for-Decorated-Logo-Generation/ aka CNST.
See cnst_LICENSE.txt and cnst_README.txt for license and readme for the original work.
Code from CNST is marked with a notice at the top of the source files.
 
## Project Breakdown

High level work items.
You can edit this, put your name on one, and commit the change if you are working on it so we don't duplicate work.

* type rendering (Done)
* style transfer (Done)
* noun dataset from shapenet (Done)
* style dataset creation (Done)
* synonym expansion (Done)
* Create UI prototype (Done)
* integration of all pieces (Done)
* testing (Done)

## Notes

* Notes from getting the code from the constrained neural style transfer paper to run are at: https://gist.github.com/ranton256/61abed764dfa31821781e5d695f92893
